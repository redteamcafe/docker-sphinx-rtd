## About this Build

This image can be used in a number of ways to both quickly generate documentation as well as host documents.


* This container uses a custom base Ubuntu image supported by Red Team Cafe.
* *Sphinx* is a free and open-source documentation generating and hosting platform. This software is designed specifically for developers and progrrammers to be able to write detailed documentation for their projects. Sphinx simplifies software documentation by automating building, versioning, and hosting of your docs. 
* *Read the Docs* is a theme that is developed for Sphinx that is widely used by developers and technical writers for a wide range of projects.
* *NGINX* is a web server that is used to host the HTML files generated 
*

# Deployment

This container has 2 different modes that is is designed to function in, CREATE and HOST.

In CREATE mode, this container will quickly generate a sphinx project based on 

## Docker CLI


Running this container with Docker CLI is recommended for one time use setups. This will run the container once in order to create the project

```
docker run -it -d --name=sphinx-rtd redteamcafe/sphinx-rtd
```

## Docker Compose



```
version: '3'

services:
  sphinx-rtd:
    image: redteamcafe/sphinx-rtd:latest
    container_name: sphinx-rtd
    environment:
      PROJECT_NAME: sphinx
      PROJECT_AUTHOR: sphinx
    volumes:
      - /docs
    ports:
      - 8080:80
    restart: unless-stopped
```
## Parameters
| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `-e PROJECT` | This is the name of the directory that the new project is stored under |
| `-e PROJECT_NAME` | Name of the Sphinx project |
| `-e PROJECT_AUTHOR` | Name of the Sphinx project author |
|HTML| yes or no (DEFAULT: yes) This enables HTML file generation support for projects|
|EPUB| yes or no (DEFAULT: no) This enables Epub file generation for projects|
|PDF| yes or no (DEFAULT: no) This enables PDF file generation for projects|
| `-p 8080:80` | Webserver port for accessing documentation. This port will be used by default when there is 1 Sphinx project. If there are multiple projects, this will be used by a project generated by the container in order to list links to all other projects. When using more than 1 project, each other project needs to have these ports exposed and assigned to the projects using environmental variables |
| `-v ./project:/sphinx/projects/` | maps the directory where the documentation is stored. When mapping directories, it is important that you place all projects in their own directory and call the directory that sits under them. This is true for single projects as well. If this is not done, then the container will not be able to recognize projects |

# Future Contributions and Features
* Not really w feature but in the future, the base image is goignt o be shifting from Ubuntu to Alpine in order to be more lightweight
* Add support for "sphinx-multibuild" to allow for multiple sources for a single project (probably not for a WHILE)
* Add support for PDF with latexpdf
* Add support for epub
* Add support for editing sphinx source in browser
* Replace the sphinx project for default with a dashboard
